            <h3>ABOUT PROJECT</h3>
            <p>Jetson is a project aimed at providing better data analytics to make better decisions to adequately prepare for contingencies in forced displacement situations. The Predictive Analytics Engine (Jetson) is an applied predictive analytics experiment taking concrete steps to provide insights on the future of displacement. Jetson was launched by UNHCR’s Innovation Service in 2017 to better understand how data can be used to predict movements of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, starting with the Horn of Africa.</p>

            <h3>MAP STORY</h3>
            <p>The map displays the relationship between conflict and displacement in Somalia from 2010 to 2017. The aim for the map is to demonstrate the general trends of both variables and to visualise a bird's eye view on displacement and conflict. The visualisation uses the Google Maps API and a custom built data visualisation engine. The data points are grouped by month of reported fatalities in conflict zones and displaced populations per region. The custom module processes over 6 million bytes of data from a CSV file and parses the values onto the map to display volume of seven years of displacement and severity of violent conflict.</p>

            <p>The data behind the engine is anonymized, aggregated per month and per region. Project JETSON uses machine-learning for building a nonparametric algorithm (model) for each region. The models used for each region represent the best &lsquo;fit&rsquo; that can explains the behaviour of seven years of historical data. The target variable (y) is # of arrivals for each region. <p>
The model is trained with data until 30 June 2017 and the date that the predictive *algorithm* was built is 1 September 2017. The engine is built in<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com"> Shiny,</a> a package for R.

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>One of the most pressing challenges for humanitarian agencies in trying to predict population movement is the information gap that exists when many people move from one place to another. This is particularly challenging, during emergencies, when the ‘fluid or rapid’ movement makes it difficult for humanitarian actors to track and estimate arrivals, and departures. In consequence, this challenge affects planning, funding of assistance and services. The challenge is exacerbated by: Lack of access to territory: referring to regions with ongoing violent conflict, to occupied territories and/or geographical areas where humanitarian actors are not present or access is denied. Lack of resources: lack of financial or human resources to deploy enumerators to collect data from specific sources or geographical locations. Lack of informants: collecting data from specific sources, or a particular group can bias the data Lack of validation: sometimes information verification is conducted only by participant observation (visual) and/or the data provided by the informants could be partial or inaccurate for diverse number of reasons.

            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>The Jetson experiment is a simple simulation model with basic human-made rules. This is the type of modelling that is used for predicting movements in ant colonies, or in financial markets. As we gather data, the model and the pattern combination becomes more complex. We aim to analyze all possible combination of variables: a) macro variables (external) such as conflict, climate and food insecurity data, but also b) behavioral or micro variables such as particular population vulnerabilities, intent of movement and other multiple contextual variables that can be later be connected by a machine-learning algorithm. Initial research explorations for this more comprehensive model are related to having a robust agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) or conducting a sensitivity analysis of system dynamics modeling. The project also intends to put a spotlight on humanitarian, and development actors to provide their data in a systematic way, in order for computers to read it and process it automatically, which means passing from a predictive analytics phase to a prescriptive analytics phase.

                    4 Project Assumptions
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The project is focused only in the population flow, both across borders and internally. This means the main research purpose is to measure changes in the population in an specific period of time (e.g. a month)</li>
                    <li>There is not one single major cause of forced displacement. There are many causes (variables) and an infinite combination of these variables, along with behavioral human patterns that lead to forced displacement. The objective of the model is not to find the cause (why?) but to explain how are people moving (patterns)</li>
                    <li>This project attempts to find interesting, and meaningful patterns in data by making assumptions from the data our partners are providing, particularly when data is not available, or is incomplete. </li>
                    <li>Some of the assumptions “do not need a model to tell a person that” the assumption is correct. Building a model goes beyond identifying the assumptions’ characteristics (e.g. we do not need a model to know people are forced to flee due to conflict). However, the model attempts to find the best combination that could predict the target variable, in this case: population flow numbers and geographical locations, in an specific period of time.</li>

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>The Jetson experiment is the first step in understanding the data about a) the population flow, and b) some of the most common variables that are observed during population movement. Responding to the questions: where, when, and how many people are being displaced is key for future contingency planning. The experiment focuses particularly on catalysts that may cause people to flee their homes in the Somalia. The main objective is to make predictions about potential displacement events by utilizing data mining, statistics, modeling, and machine-learning to analyse different data, and yield preliminary conclusions.
                <p>
                    The project aims to raise awareness of the importance of humanitarian planning in terms of having access to technically-open data. What this means is that data is in a machine-readable format. It also aims to showcase the what role data science, design, and predictive analytics application can play in the humanitarian sector. Finally, the ultimate goal is to improve the quality, and access to assistance and services for persons who are forcibly displaced. The project is useful to identify, and map existing humanitarian data gaps and services in select operations in order to improve access to demand-driven, insightful information in education, energy and the environment, connectivity, business models/cash, and other key areas.</p>

            <h3>The Data</h3>
            <p>The project uses both structured, and unstructured data points. Examples of structured data are: conflict data, population data, environmental data, to mention some. Examples of unstructured data are: weather and climate data, deforestation satellite imagery, free-text in surveys fields, social media, to mention some. The Jetson experiment aims to portray the relevance of humanitarian, and development partners collecting, systematizing, analyzing and publishing data derived from their work. Jetson aims to set a precedent of applied predictive analytics to the work of the humanitarian sector, by strengthening coordination, planning and compilation of data. </p>
